Hello everyone! I am Arjun Badola

My investing style has evolved from being a pure Benjamin Graham style investor towards Moat investor to now having a business analyst mindset while also catering thoughts towards how the market perceives the company.

In short, I look for companies which have huge market size opportunity, ability to grab that opportunity, No legal or ethical questions being raised on the management, and is available at reasonable valuation.

People from whom I keep learning:

1. Warren Buffett: I learnt how to think about companies, staying in the game for long-term and choosing quality business even if you need to pay a little for them.

2. Charlie Munger: After reading about him I developed my diversification framework, which is having multi-disciplinary approach (Mental Models) towards investing but opposite in terms of portfolio by having a concentrated portfolio.

3. Prof. Sanjay Bakshi: He is also heavily influenced by the above two mentioned but I liked his valuation method which includes three stages of margin of safety, hence I adopted his valuation framework.

Some of my best content includes CCL Products (India) Ltd Analysis, What Edge Do Retail Investors Have?, Why You Need To Fail Fast, or Revisited: A New Perspective on Startups.

I am also a law student who has interest in Company Law, Contracts Law, and Securities Law.
