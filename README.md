Hello everyone! I am Arjun Badola, a law student with an interest in analyzing businesses.

My investing style has evolved from being a pure Benjamin Graham style investor towards Moat investor to now having a business analyst mindset while also catering thoughts towards how the market perceives the company.

So, In short - I look for companies which have huge market size opportunity, ability to grab that opportunity, No legal or ethical questions being raised on the management, and is available at reasonable valuation.

Currently I have been working in collaboration with [SOIC](https://soic.in/blogs) for writing indsutry and company analysis reports.

People from whom I keep learning:

1. Warren Buffett: I learnt how to think about companies, staying in the game for long-term and choosing quality business even if you need to pay a little for them.

2. Charlie Munger: After reading about him I developed my diversification framework, which is having multi-disciplinary approach (Mental Models) towards investing but opposite in terms of portfolio by having a concentrated portfolio.

3. Bharat Shah: After reading his book I realized how important it is to look for grow in companies. Here is a qoute by him which would summarize this concept: "When growth goes away, equities reduce to a bond. It will be treated like a bond for a while. If the picture deteriorates further, then it will be treated worse than a bond."

4. Ishmohit Arora: He is the founder of SOIC. By writing reports for SOIC I have learnt that if your business analysis is strong, one would automatically understand the valuation part. Valuation must always come after getting the business analysis right.

Also my field of interest in law disciplinary are Company Law, Contracts Law, and Securities Law.
