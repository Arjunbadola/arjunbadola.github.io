I believe knowing what not to do is far more important than knowing what to do.

I think because even if you know what to do and you do according to that process, you could still fail and not get the desired result because you might have failed to avoid things which distract you.

Here is a quote by Steve Jobs to add on:

    “Deciding what not to do is as important as deciding what to do.” Steve Jobs

The most common mistake we do in our daily lives is accepting work which we don’t like to work on but due to some reasons we accept that work.

The most dangerous reason I have heard of is, “I had free time”. Please don’t accept any work just because you are free!

You would rationalize it by saying that you have plenty of ‘free time’ at hand so its okay to work on it, but you need to reminder you are also wasting your energy on a task which you would normally hate doing.

A lot of people including me agree to do things which will add no value in their life.

At the end of such activity, we just regret saying yes.
Well, its not easy…

Sometimes you will be forced to do things which you don’t like, you would need to interact with people you don’t want to, or, you would need to learn some skills which you are not interested in learning.

It can be due to job in which you are currently working or due to a course which is mandatory for all students in your college or, due to your gullible nature which makes you end up with other people’s work.

Well, this article is not going to provide you with the solution for that but a simple advise I would give is that whenever you get the first opportunity to reject such a task, DO IT!

Now these things also extend to the world of investing. People in investing community also end up doing things which if they might have avoided at the first place they would have done far better for themselves.
Things one should not do in Investing
Getting Updated with News (noise)

It might sound good or you might get an adrenaline rush by reading news at the very second it out there.

But I believe if you are a long term investor then such things could act against you.

When you keep reading news again and again regarding the company you are invested in you get an urge to act.

And as a long term investor its your job is to fight these urges. As I had mentioned in my previous article that being in the game for long term is a huge advantage.

But when you are bombarded with continuous flow of news then you get a feeling known as FOMO i.e. Fear Of Missing Out.

Let’s take a recent example for explaining FOMO.

I am quite sure that on march 23th 2020 almost everyone in the investing community might have faced FOMO, as that was the day market fell down due to outbreak of coronavirus.

Everybody had started selling and the news channels were talking as if the world is going to end.

But here we are, the market has almost fully recovered to the pre-covid levels.

Now, if you would have sold your stocks on 23th just because everyone was doing it

Your portfolio might lost your capital permanently and many investors including Warren Buffett define risk for themselves as ‘permanent loss of capital’.

Now, you would ask if not news then how would one get information regarding their companies they are invested in or are tracking?

Well, the answer to this problem was provided by Rolf Dobelli in his book, “Stop Reading The News“. He said instead for reading news and jumping on to the conclusions you should read long articles/bog posts which are not sponsored to write in someone’s favor.

As the information available in such pieces is generally well researched and the person writing about it knows what they is talking about, unlike news.
Looking for ideas

Now this might sound counter-intuitive but let me explain.

By not looking for ideas I don’t mean avoid new ideas. What I mean is don’t look for them consciously.

Great ideas tend to come automatically. You just need to equip yourself with the knowledge which will enable you to recognize the opportunity.

In my article ‘A Leap of Faith?’ I had written about my question which I asked to the famous investor Basant Maheshwari.

By question was regarding identifying great ideas and he answered the following:

“these things will come to you your own. You will have to take a leap of faith.”

Well, this would for sure sound stupid to someone who has recently started analyzing companies but trust when he said this I concurred it till some extend.

I started doing a introspection of how I had generated some ideas (even though they were not great) and I realized it came to me naturally.

Idea of investing in Eicher Motors came to me while having a conversation with my elder brother. The conversation had suddenly turned to his bike which he used to own Royal Enfield Desert Strom 500cc.

Likewise, the idea of investing in CCL Products (India) ltd struck into my mind while I was reading about Prof. Sanjay Bakshi.

So, even I believe that most of the good ideas just come to you but only at one condition, you must be well equipped with knowledge to recognize them.
Not holding cash (when you can’t find ideas)

I thinking holding cash is important if you are not able to find ideas to invest in.

The problem here is that when people have excess cash they start investing in stocks where they don’t have solid conviction.

They invest just because they have extra cash.

Holding cash is very challenging. But we have Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger who have been sitting on a pile of cash for a very very long time.

When asked about the cash they hold they simply reply that they are waiting for the right opportunity.

Before, you start comparing yourself with Warren and Charlie you need to remember that they have billion of dollars to deal with.

They can’t just buy a company if they think it is under ‘priced’ they need a lot of technical aspects in their support.

Like the stock should be liquid enough so that they could buy enough shares, or, sometimes as they start buying the price increases significantly so they have to stop buying.

Plus they also don’t want to move their money very quickly as the transactional charges they would end up paying will be huge.

Whereas, retail investors are not limited by these things.

We can quickly enter a stock and exit if even realize our analysis was wrong.

Here is a video where the man himself (Warren Buffett) accepts that if he had less capital to deal with he would have taken a different approach.
Tracking the Stock price

I have already shed some light on this topic in my previous article, where I had mentioned about the comparison Warren Buffett makes with stock market and buying a farm.

I believe tracking the stock price is very stressful.

Human mind is such that it craves for reasoning for everything thing we see or experience.

But it is impossible that all human in this world (especially in the stock market) act rationally.

So, when you start looking at the stock prices on a daily basis you slowly start to find reasons for price increase or decrease.

You start thinking what is going on with the company and this thinking attracts you towards financial news and trust me that is not a place where one should look for answers.

Now if you really can’t find a rational answer you start to overthink.

Soon, you start proving your analysis wrong which is a good thing only if done in a rational way but if done in the wrong way it could lead to you missing a wonderful opportunity.
Inshort

Knowing what not to do is far more important than knowing what to do, being it in life, business, or, investing. As there are far more chances that you would fail not because you did the process wrong but because you got distracted towards a wrong thing.
