ALERT: This is a motivation post. Avoid if you hate such things.


    “The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.”– Steve Jobs

There is quite thin line between the person who made it and who could not.

This line is not noticeable from a standard perspective. You need to have a ‘crazy’ mindset to notice the different and implement it.
What is a ‘crazy’ mindset?

In simple words, it is doing something which the consensus would normally think as ‘too much’ work/effort.

It is believing in yourself and getting better day by day.

Thinking plays a vital role here.

    “If you can imagine it, you can achieve it. If you can dream it, you can become it.”William Arthur Ward

Now if you can never imagine you bringing the change in the world then it becomes near to impossible for you to achieve that goal.

The person who thought that we could light a room with electricity succeeded in inventing bulb,

The person who thought that we could travel on something better than horse built car,

The person who thought that we could air-travel built aircraft,

And this list can go on.
So, what makes the different?

It is the few extra minutes which you put in and then those minutes starts to compound over time.

The extra effort you put in everyday will make all the difference.

Let’s take an example of reading a book.

If you wait for the motivation to kick in and read only when you ‘feel’ like then, it would become quite difficult to finish a book.

But if you spread this process of putting efforts across a timeline then going through the mental process won’t be that difficult.

Suppose, you decide to read 20 pages a day, that’s it.

Now, some of you might think 20 pages is too less and it would take too much time to finish the book.

But the key here is consistency.

If you do start reading 20 pages a day then how many books could you end up reading per year?

20 x 365 = 7,300 pages/ 300 = 24 books!

(Assuming an average of 300 pages per book)

Trust me that’s quite a good number.

There is a saying, if you read 3 books on a topic you would end up knowing more than what 95% of people know.

It really doesn’t matter if the above statement is true or not, but I hope you get what I am trying to say here.

Just to show you what reading consistently could do over long term. Lets say for a period of 5 years…24 x 5 = 120 books in 5 years.

Who am I to say these thing? Nobody. I just believe in this type of thinking and hope things play out well. Cheers!
