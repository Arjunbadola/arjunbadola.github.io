For the first time at SOIC we are analysing a business from the agriculture segment: _**VST Tiller and Tractors**_. The business has many growth triggers coming in and it seems that the new management is aggressive towards achieving their new vision.

Through this blog we try to answer:
1.	Business Segments and Size of Opportunity
2.	Growth Triggers
3.	Competition Intensity
4.	Antithesis
5.	Valuation: Bull, Bear, and Base.
